# This is Basic Clone of Tiwtter UI made with React.js and uses Firebase for backend, styling has been done with plain CSS
# I have just made the basic text tweet functionality but if you want a challenge I will leave other functionalities for you to contribute
# Some Ideas are:
- Make the tweet Like button turn Red with animation on clicking.
- Add image, video etc. icons below the tweet Texarea
- Add functionality to tweet images and videos.
- Add the time feature where all the tweets are aligned according to their timing of posting.
